This is a text-based implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that I'm currently working on as a side project. It is written in C++ and currently unfinished.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What it can do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Player chooses their 'token' (the X or O that they will use in the game).</li>
  <li>Set up and display the board.</li>
  <li>Set a 'token' on the board when a human or computer player chooses a grid square.</li>
  <li>Computer "chooses" a move (see below).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What remains to be done</h2>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Detect when the game is over (the program can detect game ending conditions, but at the moment can't differentiate between a draw or a player getting a tic tac toe).</li>
  <li>Intelligent move selection for computer player. At the moment, the code continually selects a grid square for the computer's next move until an empty square is chosen. It's a mess. I know it's a mess, and I intend to eventually tighten up the code so that there's more logic involved.</li>
  <li>Loading previous players. Human user should be able to load a basic text file with information about each player's number of wins (and possibly player names).</li>
  <li>Player names?</li>
  <li>Implementation in Qt (eventually)</li>
</ul>

You're free to look at the code, download it, and modify it to your satisfaction; I really don't care too much as long as you identify that I (Jon Buckner) am the original author of the code.
